1.61_00   2013-04-15

  [BUG FIXES]
  - Adjust the privs needed for the DROP/CREATE table test. [GH#35]
    (Joe Crotty)

  - Fixed RT84170 - when using scrollable cursors and you've done a
    positioned fetch and then keep fetching until the end of the
    result-set calls to fetch never return undef and you keep getting
    the last row forever. Also added test case to the 51scroll.t test
    (Martin J. Evans).

1.60      2013-04-01
 - Move github repository to github.com/pythian/DBD-Oracle.

1.58      2013-03-05
  - promote 1.57_00 to official release

1.57_00   2013-02-07
  [BUG FIXES]

  - fix RT46628 - bind_param_inout ORA_RSET causes MSWin32 access
    violation and RT82663 - Errors if a returned SYS_REFCURSOR is not
    opened (Martin J. Evans)

  - Fix RT82663. If a procedure/function returns a SYS_REFCURSOR which
    was never opened DBD::Oracle magics a DBI statement handle into
    existence and attempts to describe it (which fails). This change
    examines a returned SYS_REFCURSOR and if it it is initialised but
    not executed does not create a DBI statement handle and returns
    undef instead. So now if you have a procedure/function which
    returns a SYS_REFCURSOR and never open it you'll get undef back
    instead of a useless statement handle.  Extended 50cursor.t test
    to check the above fix. (Martin J. Evans)

  [DOCUMENTATION]
  - Update Lion instructions for 64-bit Instant Client. (GH#37, patch by
    theory)

1.56      2013-01-08
  - fix t/26exe_array.t in the case of no db connection (RT82506,
    reported by Peter Rabbitson)

1.54      2013-01-03
 - promote 1.53_00 to official release

1.53_00      2012-12-18

  [BUG FIXES]
  - Fix RT69350 - 31lob.t was using $lob after destroying its parent $sth
        (Rob Davies)

  - Fix memory leak in execute_array (John Scoles, Pierre-Alain Blanc)

  - Fix RT80349 - The error message in execute_for_fetch when a row fails
    can contain the wrong error count. Thanks to Steffen Goeldner for
    RT and patch.

  - Fix RT80375 - no exception when execute_for_fetch fails and
    ArrayTupleStatus is not specified. Also the tuple count calculation
    resulted in an undefined warning. Thanks to Steffen Goeldner for
    RT and patch.

  - Fix RT80487. Skip XMLType tests if Oracle less than V9. Thanks to
    Steffen Goeldner for RT and patch.

  - Fix RT80486 for 31lob_extended.t. In old old Oracle8,
    SYS_REFCURSOR is not defined. Instead of CREATE/DROP PROCEDURE,
    use anonymous block. Thanks to Steffen Goeldner for RT and patch.

  - Fix bug in 39attr.t which could fail if using an Oracle Client >
    11 but not >= 11.2 (Martin J. Evans)

  - ora_server_version was not documented.

  - Fix RT80566. 70meta.t test fails with Oracle 8 because
    ALL_TAB_COLUMNS.CHAR_LENGTH is new in Oracle 9. Use DATA_LENGTH
    instead on pre-9 versions. Thanks to Steffen Goeldner for RT and
    patch.

  - Fix RT80704. 51scroll.t test checks scrollable cursors but assumes
    all Oracles support them (only 9 and above). Thanks to Steffen
    Goeldner for RT and patch.

  - Fix RT81067. 58object.t has some subtype tests and subtypes were
    introduced in Oracle 9. Skip if < Oracle 9. Thanks to Steffen
    Goeldner for RT and patch.

  - Fix RT81317. 34pres_lobs.t uses the Data Interface for Persistent
    LOBs which is new in Oracle 9. Skip if < Oracle 9. Thanks to
    Steffen Goeldner for RT and patch.

  [MISCELLANEOUS]

  - The original 26exe_array test was replaced some time ago with a
    copy of the one from DBD::ODBC. Since then I've fixed issues in
    the DBD::ODBC one and added more tests (like tests for some RTs
    above). To make keeping them in synch easier I've modularised the
    tests. Hence new ExecuteArray.pm. (Martin J. Evans)

  - simple code clean up, replacing 3 uses of safemalloc with Newz
    (John Scoles)

  - Add DBI as a configure prereq for the META* files (thanks to Joe Crotty)

  - New FAQ entry on Solaris and setting linker library path
    (Martin J. Evans)

  - Removed ineffective commit in 34pres_lobs.t (Martin J. Evans)

    Ciornii, RT#82040)

  - Changed any use of if SvUPGRADE to remove the if test as per email
    from Dave Mitchell and posting at
    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2012-12/msg00424.html
    (Martin J. Evans)

1.52      2012-10-19

 - promote 1.51_00 to official release

1.51_00   2012-09-28

  [BUG FIXES]

  - fix serious memory corruption in TAF support (Martin J. Evans)

  - fix finding client in situation where client and server both
    installed but different architectures (patch by H.Merijn Brand)

  - fix memory leak in TAF handling - the TAF function was leaked
    (Martin J. Evans)

  - fix issue with taf_function being set to a scalar which goes
    out of scope before the callback is made (Martin J. Evans)

  - fix RT46739 if a connection breaks the environment handle is
    not thrown away (Martin J. Evans)

  - ora_driver_name was not defaulted to the correct DBD::Oracle
    version (Martin J. Evans)

  - ora_driver_name, ora_client_info, ora_client_identifier,
    ora_action and ora_oci_success_warn were set twice (if specified)
    on connect as they were not deleted from the connect attributes
    once handled. Code now leaves the setting to the later STORE DBI
    calls (Martin J. Evans)

  - fixed some compiler warnings for %lf (Martin J. Evans)

  - fixed RT78700 - column_info reports wrong size for char semantic
    char type columns (Douglas Wilson).

  [CHANGE IN BEHAVIOUR]

  - ora_taf and ora_taf_sleep were redundant and have been removed.
    To enable/disable TAF simply set ora_taf_function and if you
    want to sleep do it in your callback (Martin J. Evans)

  - ora_taf_function can now be a code reference as well as a string
    (Martin J. Evans)

  [ENHANCEMENTS]

  - the ora_can_taf method was virtually useless since you can only
    call it after connecting and to enable TAF you had to do it in the
    connect call. Now you can enable and disable TAF at any time by
    simply setting or clearing the ora_taf_function (see RT78811)
    (Martin J. Evans)

  - the ora_taf_function is now passed a third argument of the
    connection handle (Martin J. Evans)

  - RT78987 - removed Oraperl.pm and oraperl.ph; these files will be
    available in a separate distribution named "Oraperl" (David Perry)

  [MISCELLANEOUS]

  - hide dr, db and st packages from PAUSE (Martin J. Evans)

  - added a few more simple TAF tests (Martin J. Evans)

1.50      2012-08-15
 - RT78965 - Remove Oraperl tests (which were forcing a require on Oraperl)

1.48      2012-08-09
 - promote 1.47_00 to official release

1.47_00   2012-07-11

  [BUG FIXES]

  - fixed redeclaration of $len in 31lob.t - (Martin J, Evans)

  - RT55028 - stop segfaulting when attempting to read empty lobs
    (Martin J. Evans)

  - RT69059 - Despite OCIPing being documented as added in 10.2 AIX
    does not seem to have it in 10.2 leading to undefined symbol -
    Martin J. Evans

  [DOCUMENTATION]
  - Promoted the troubleshooting for the different architectures to
    POD documents, for easier/prettier access.

  - Added a troubleshooting entry for RT71819 - bound output
    parameters may be returned in the wrong order (Martin J. Evans)

1.46      2012-07-11
 - promote 1.45_00 to official release

1.45_00   2012-06-21

 [CHANGE IN BEHAVIOUR]

 - In future versions of DBD::Oracle ora_verbose will be changed
   so that it is simply a switch to turn DBI's DBD tracing on or off.
   A true value will turn it on and a false value will turn it off.
   DBI's "DBD" tracing was not available when ora_verbose was created
   and ora_verbose adds an additional test to every trace test.

 [BUG FIXES]

 - Fixed RT76695 - offset passed to ora_fetch_scroll should not affect
   normal fetches (Martin J. Evans)

 - Fixed RT76410 - fetch after fetch absolute always returns
   the same row (Martin J. Evans);

 - Fixed RT75721 - does not build with Oracle 9.2 (Martin J. Evans)

 - Fixed RT71343 - Oracle 9i does not have OCI_ATTR_TAF_ENABLED
   or OCI_ATTR_RESERVED_15/16 so cannot build (Martin J. Evans)

 - skip 24implicit_utf8.t if chr set is not UTF-8 (Martin J. Evans)

 - Fixed RT76269 - ora_taf_sleep was documented as taf_sleep by
   accident. There was no way to stop the TAF reconnect attempts.
   If you want to try another connect attempt in your taf handler you
   now need to return OCI_FO_RETRY from it. (Martin J. Evans)

 [MISCELLANEOUS]

 - minor change to confusing debug output for input parameters
   (Martin J. Evans)

 - RT72989 - add note to trouble shooting guide re this RT and
   Module::Runtime (Martin J. Evans)

1.44      2012-04-23
 - promote 1.43_00 to official release

1.43_00   2012-03-30

 [BUG FIXES]
 - Applied patch from Rafael Kitover (Caelum) to column_info to handle
   DEFAULT columns greater in length than the DBI default of 80. The
   DEFAULT column is a long and it is a PITA to have to set
   LongReadLen which you can only do on a connection handle in
   DBD::Oracle. The default maximum size is now 1Mb; above that you
   will still have to set LongReadLen (Martin J. Evans)

 - Fixed 70meta and rt74753-utf8-encoded to not die if you cannot
   connect to Oracle or you cannot install from CPAN if you have not
   set up a valid Oracle connection.

 - Fixed 75163. Bfile lobs were not being opened before fetching if
   ora_auto_lobs was disabled (Martin J. Evans).

   Note: this has a minor impact on non bfile lobs when ora_auto_lobs
   is not in force as an additional call to OCILobFileIsOpen will be
   made.

 - Removed all DBIS usage fixing and speeding up threaded
   Perls (Martin J. Evans).

 - Minor fix to avoid use of uninitialised variable in 31lob.t (Martin J. Evans)

 [DOCUMENTATION]
 - clarification of when StrictlyTyped/DiscardString can be used and
   LongReadLen (Martin J. Evans)

 - Documented the 3rd type of placeholder and rewrote the existing
   pod for placeholders (Martin J. Evans).

1.42      2012-03-13
 - skip rt74753-utf8-encoded.t if db is not unicode

1.40      2012-03-08
 - promote 1.39_00 to official release

  Anthony DeRobertis, reported by JuliÃ¡n Moreno PatiÃ±o)

 [BUG FIXES]

   warnings in ora_server_version when the database is not open
   [RT72623] (Martin J. Evans)

 [BUG FIXES]
 - if bind_col is called with a TYPE but no bind attributes like
   StrictlyTyped or DiscardString are set DBD::Oracle still attempts
   to call sql_type_cast which is pointless (Martin J. Evans)
 - if bind_col is called with a TYPE other than SQL_NUMERIC,
   SQL_INTEGER or SQL_DOUBLE and bind attributes like StrictlyTyped or
   DiscardString a warning was not issued that the type is unsupported
   and no data was returned (Martin J. Evans)
 - Fix test so it works with perl compiled with -Duselongdouble [RT71852]
 - Apply patch from Charles Jardine for better building against a full
   Oracle 11 install [RT72463] (Martin J. Evans)

 [DOCUMENTATION]
 - Added notes to bind_col documenting the fact that setting a TYPE
   does not affect how the column is bound in Oracle, only what

    in string context it returns the full "major.minor.foo.bar" version string.
  Changed some SUCCESS_WITH_INFO situtions to be treated as a "warning"
    by setting $DBI::err to "0" (and so trigger PrintWarn in DBI >= 1.43)
    eg "ORA-28011: the account will expire soon; change your password now"
    and package compilation errors.

  Added automatic support for UTF-8 for both NLS_LANG and NLS_NCHAR
    Many thanks to Lincoln Baxter who did most of the hard work and testing

  built with the old Oracle 7 OCI interface.

  NOTE: This release will build for perl 5.5 only after some manual edits
  which are detailed in README.help.  Future releases may not build for 5.5.
  Perl 5.5.3 is very old and and upgrading to at least 5.6.1 is recommended.
  The DBI itself has required perl >= 5.6.0 since DBI 1.38, August 2003.

    length of 28 characters. Warning: this change may break code that
    doesn't pass bind_param_inout() a length value large enough for the
    returned string. (The minimum length was not documented and should
    not have been relied upon. This change currently only applies to the
    CHAR type but may extended to all string types in a later release.)
  Changed type_info_all() to return the same type info as Oracle's own
    ODBC driver does, thanks to Andy Hassall for the data.
    The types include LOBs but not the new TIMESTAMP and INTERVAL types.

  Added OCI8 handle/descriptor name to trace output for some API calls.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 1.09   27th August 2001

  Changed behaviour when OCIStmtExecute() returns OCI_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO:
    used to be treated as OCI_SUCCESS, now also sets $DBI::err/$DBI::errstr
    and will therefore trigger RaiseError/PrintError if they are set.

  Build:
    Fixed default build to set LD_RUN_PATH at build time. Yeah.
    Fixed parsing of Oracle's .mk files to handle += (appending values).
    Fixed detection of 'OCI' dire for Win32 Oracle >=8.1 thanks to many.
    Improved test for gcc in Makefile.PL thanks to Ian Kallen.
    Improved build rule detection thanks to Jonathan Segal.
    Don't merge text from Oracle's .mk into generated Makefile (use -f to reenable).
    Fixed bad test in plsql.t so shouldn't give false negatives.
    Added t/ph_type.t to test placeholder type issues thanks to James Jurach.
    Retested for perl 5.4.4 for possibly the last time. You have been warned.
      In future I'll only be testing on perl >= 5.5.3 and >=5.6.1.
  Documentation:
    Documented workaround for hang in "repetitive connect" test thanks to Alexi Lookin.

    when using Oracle >= 8.1.x (untested at the moment)
  Updated Makefile.PL and README.hpux thanks to Lincoln Baxter.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 1.07 5th June 2001

  This release is mostly targeted at the needs of the new Oracle::OCI module.
    It's not a general release and not recommended for production use.

  Fixed SCALE/PRECISION/TYPE values for numeric types, including FLOAT,
    to be more correct thanks to Steffen Goeldner.
    NOTE: this may break code that depends on the old values!
  Fixed Win32::TieRegistry and Tie::Registry usage thanks to David Bradford.
  Fixed insert/update of LOBs while AutoCommit enabled.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 1.06 14th July 2000

  Fixed ora_ph_type attribute to allow 96 or 97.
  Fixed compile failure with Oracle 7.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 1.05 13th July 2000

  Added $dbh->{ora_ph_type} attribute to define default bind type:
     1=> VARCHAR2,  does strip trailing spaces, embedded \0 bytes okay
     5=> STRING, doesn't strip trailing spaces, embedded \0 ends string
    96=> CHAR,   doesn't strip trailing spaces, embedded \0 okay
    97=> CHARZ,  doesn't strip trailing spaces, embedded \0 ends string?
    The two CHAR types force 'blank-padded comparison semantics'.
    Needs testing and documenting, volunteers most welcome!
  Added (many) typecasts to avoid compiler warnings thanks to Denis Goddard.
  Added ability to pass existing DBD::Oracle select statement handle
    (cursor) back _into_ Oracle as a ref cursor type thanks to Mike Moretti.
    Note that this enables a workaround for closing ref cursors:
    $dbh->do("BEGIN CLOSE :cursor; END;", undef, $sth_ref_csr_to_close);
  Improved Win32 support in Makefile.PL thanks to Michael A. Chase.
  Workaround Win32::TieRegistry FETCH error during global destruction.

  Added OCI8 re-authentication thanks to John Tobey.
  Added t/long.t test script for LONG/LONG RAW/CLOB/BLOB handling.
  Length of fetched LONG RAW string now 2 * LongReadLen for OCI7 & 8.

  Fixed OCI8 non-reporting of LobWrite error.
  Fixed OCI8 "LongReadLen too small and/or LongTruncOk not set" hint.

  Finally fixed "Can't bind unknown placeholder" (hopefully :-).
  Fixed placeholder parser to ignore comments, thanks to JD Laub.
  Fixed placeholder parser to ignore double-quotes strings.
  No longer changes ORACLE_HOME to match oratab, by default.
  Fixes for OCI 8:
    Fixed selection of very large numbers (132 digits).
    Fixed small memory leak in parameter binding.
    Fixed small memory leak in prepare of statements using LOBs.
    Fixed binding empty strings.
    Fixed OCILobRead error when fetching of zero length LOBs.
    Fixed OCILobWrite of zero length to use OCILobTrim instead.
    Treat SUCCESS_WITH_INFO from OCIStmtExecute as SUCCESS.
    Enabled OCI_CRED_EXT login thanks to Alan Burlison & Jeremy Brinkley.
  Modified hints/svr4.pl - SVR4 users please test.
  Updated Alan Burlison's ora_explain Tk tool to version 1.0.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.59 (Oraperl 1.37), 27th December 1998

  Fixed detection of ambiguous LOB-param-to-table-field assignment
  (previous fix had typo). Only affects multiple LOBs in same table.
  Added support for Oracle 8's "... RETURNING foo,bar INTO :foo,:bar"
  for simple scalar types (not LOBs or arrays) via bind_param_inout.
  Cleaned up the code.
  Improved Oracle 8 library selection code for Win32 (untested).

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.58 (Oraperl 1.37), 22nd December 1998

  Fixed detection of ambiguous LOB-param-to-table-field assignment.
  Added bind_param ora_field attribute to disambiguate if needed.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.57 (Oraperl 1.37), 21st December 1998

  Fixed bug preventing fetching LONGs when using OCI 8, better.
  (Oracle bug #641812 not involved. Should work for all 8.0.x)

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.56 (Oraperl 1.37), 19th December 1998

  Fixed bug preventing fetching LONGs when using OCI 8.
  (Oracle bug #641812 may still cause failure prior to v8.0.5.)
  Fixed LongTruncOk to work when using OCI 8.
  Fixed bug in table name detection code for OCI8 LOB refetch.
  SCALE & PRECISION work for OCI 7 & 8.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.55 (Oraperl 1.37), 16th December 1998

  Major internal work to support Oracle 8 OCI.
  Oracle 8 LOBs are supported and treated as LONGs (DBD::Oracle works
  hard to hide the complexities of handling Lob Locators for you).
  See Oracle 8 section in the docs for more details.
  Added $sth->{TYPE}.
  SCALE & PRECISION are implemented but return 0 (Oracle bug?).
  DBI 1.02 or later is required.
  Assorted build time Makefile.PL improvements.
  Builds with 5.004_04, 5.005_02 and 5.005_54 (not _53).
  Added "use DBD::Oracle qw(:ora_types);"

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.54 (Oraperl 1.37), 14th August 1998

  Added $dbh->type_info_all.
  Fixed $dbh->tables (partly by renaming to new $dbh->table_info).
  data_sources no longer adds abbreviated versions of tnsnames.
  Alan Burlison's whizzo Tk based explain script now bundled.
  Revised workaround for "Can't bind unknown placeholder '3'" errors.
  Doubled default automatic row cache size (now approx 5KB).
  The resetting of Oracle's SIGCHD handler to SA_RESTART can
  now be disabled by setting the env var DBD_ORACLE_SIGCHLD=0.
  Fixed Makefile.PL -c to better avoid shared Oracle lib.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.53 (Oraperl 1.37), 3rd August 1998

  Further build fixes (esp kpudc problem with Oracle 8).
  Now prefers oracle.mk over proc.mk again.
  Only $ENV{ORA_CLIENT_LIB} ||= 'shared' if shared lib exists.
  Builds okay with 5.005-thread (not tested).

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.52 (Oraperl 1.37), 28th July 1998

  Assorted build fixes (esp. Win32, HP-UX and AIX).
  More hints on error messages, especially long truncation and
  field-level errors when fetching.
  Compiles okay now for systems without SQLT_CUR defined.
  Only sets SA_RESTART on SIGCLD if connect was successful.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.51 (Oraperl 1.37), 5rd July 1998

  Makefile.PL no longer tries to link with just -lclntsh directly :-(
  Improvements to some HP-UX builds (hopefully).
  DBI->data_sources ' dummy ' value removed (and list now sorted).
  connect failure now shows actual Oracle error message again.
  Initial (incomplete) support for binding cursor vars (see t/plsql.t).

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.50 (Oraperl 1.36), 3rd June 1998

  Makefile.PL changes: fixed -c option, now searches for .h files,
  tries alternate location for sysliblist, checks for executable
  orainst/inspdver before using it.
  Fixed cursor leak.
  Added first word of tnsnames.ora name as aliases if no clash.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.49 (Oraperl 1.36), 1st June 1998

  Further improvements to build process over 0.48.
  Fixed broken truncation error in 0.48.
  Fetch ORACLE_SID from Win32 registry (thanks to Preston Bannister)
  Improved automatic row cache sizing (prompted by Jon Meek).
  Added $sth->{ora_cache_rows} and $sth->{ora_est_row_width}
  as read-only attributes to make cache size logic easier to test.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.48 (Oraperl 1.36), 25th May 1998

  THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL RELEASE - USE WITH CAUTION!
  Now links to -lclntsh directly (Thanks to Bruce Nelson and others)
  Workaround for broken backticks after login (Thanks to Warren Jones)
  Now finds and reads tnsnames.ora to disambiguate dbnames in connect.

  $h->{InactiveDestroy} = 1; now works reliably (with DBI 0.90).
  Makefile.PL changed for Oracle8. Thanks to Philippe Vanhaesendonck.
  Long params now work. Thanks to Michael Harvey.
  (Long params don't yet work for inout params.)
  AutoCommit flag now per-dbh. Thanks to Irving Reid.
  Fixed panic: _dbd_rebind_ph when binding an undef.
  Added $dbh->ping method (for Apache::DBI users).
  Some field-level fetch errors didn't cause the fetch to fail
  (the field was simply set undef).
  LongReadLen now works (if $Oraperl::ora_trunc unset or <= 0)
  LongTruncOk now works (for non oraperl mode handle).

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.46 (Oraperl 1.34), 20th June 1997

  Fixed Makefile.PL to work with 5.004_01.
  Some VMS support from Dan Sugalski <sugalsd@stargate.lbcc.cc.or.us>
  If ORACLE_HOME isn't set, Oracle.pm no longer tries to guess it.
  bind_param_inout now checks for read-only variables.
  Requires DBI 0.84.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.45 (Oraperl 1.33), 16th June 1997

  A $dbh DESTROY without an explicit disconnect does a rollback.
  Note that this may 'break' existing 'lazy' code but is completely
  essential for robust applications. See comments in Oracle.xs.

  Added Makefile.PL changes from Eric Bartley and others.
  The changes should fix build problems for Oracle 7.3.x.

  Requires DBI 0.83.

  Oraperl now uses DBI->connect and thus works with DBI 0.81 to
  automatically support Apache without requiring script changes.

  Reworked parameter binding in preparation for future changes.
  - mutated placeholder values are now automatically rebound.
  - in/out vars that become undef/null after binding now work.
  - transparent support for longs should be easier to implement.

  Added Win32 support from Jeff Urlwin.

  Added some documentation to DBD::Oracle for 'perldoc DBD::Oracle'.

  Most tests now converted to standard t/*.t format.
  Added $sth->{NULLABLE}->[$field].
  Added private plsql_errstr method: $txt=$dbh->func('plsql_errstr')
  to fetch PL/SQL error messages. Thanks to Bob Menteer.
  Added $sth->{ora_pad_empty} and ORAPERL_PAD_EMPTY env var
  for better compatibility with old oraperl.
  Added $sth->{AutoCommit} FETCH.
  Added $sth->{ChopBlanks} (but not yet tested).
  No longer asks Oracle for text of login failure message since
  that can cause oracle's code to hang (sigh). We provide fake text
  for the most common errors and a useful default for the rest.
  You can set DBD_ORACLE_LOGIN_ERR env var to revert to old behaviour.

    The Copyright terms for DBD::Oracle have changed and now read as follows:
  You may distribute under the terms of either the GNU General Public
  License or the Artistic License, as specified in the Perl README file,
  with the exception that it cannot be placed on a CD-ROM or similar media
  for commercial distribution without the prior approval of the author.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.44 (Oraperl 1.30), 14th Jan 1997

  Fixed leak in read_blob (thanks to Jurgen Botz for the patch).
  Improved automatic cache sizing (so better default caching).
  Negative cache size specifies desired cache/transfer size in bytes.
  Added $rowid = $csr->{ora_rowid} attribute (untested, please test).
  (Use via $csr->bind_param(1, $rowid, { ora_type => 11 });)
  Queries returning LONG's are no longer cached (so there's no
  need to set the cache to 1 explicitly to get read_blob to work).
  Added a test using string type with bind_param_inout in test.pl.
  Worked around the rather sad VMS linker case insensitivity.
  Worked around VMS linker length warning on XS...disconnect_all.
  Makefile.PL deletes non-existant files from $(COMPOBJS)
  (thanks to aburlison@cix.compulink.co.uk for the original patch)

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.43 (Oraperl 1.30), 29nd Oct 1996

  Fixed serious 'false ora_errno 1 after short select' bug.
  Worked around oracle bug that makes cda->ft unreliable.
  Do not use DBD::Oracle 0.41 or 0.42.
  Cursors are now 'describe'd at prepare time thus making
  NUM_OF_FIELDS always available. Describe does nothing for
  non-select operations. NUM_OF_FIELDS > 0 is now used to
  select between oexec() and oexfet() in execute().
  Added more internal debugging. Improved test.pl.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.42 (Oraperl 1.30), 28nd Oct 1996

  Fixed serious 'cache empty after re-bind' bug.
  Do not use DBD::Oracle 0.41.
  Implemented oexfet (combined execute and cache fetch) for
  select operations. This is a further significant speed up.
  Many selects now make only one trip to Oracle (after prepare)
  which combines the execute and fetching multiple rows.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.41 (Oraperl 1.30), 22nd Oct 1996

  Added the long overdue row cache to DBD::Oracle.
  (Thanks to Reetnem@aol.com for providing a patch that prompted
  me to complete the work.)
  Oraperl $ora_cache and cache parameter to ora_open now work.
  Default cache size is adjusted automatically for row width.
  Major reworking of field buffer memory management.
  Added a more internal debugging.
  Further updates to the README files.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.40 (Oraperl 1.29), 14th Oct 1996

  WARNING - This release contains significant changes to the
  placeholding binding code. You should test it carefully
  before using in live systems.

  Implemented PL/SQL output values via $sth->bind_param_inout.
  See the code at the end of test.pl for example usage.

  Binding is now implemented using obndra rather than obndrv.
  This may have a subtle effect when matching char fields
  against placeholders with trailing spaces.

  Fixed bind_param ora_type attribute. Thanks to Stephen Zander
  for the patch.  Updated README's. Added README.longs.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.39 (Oraperl 1.29), 23rd Sep 1996

  Fix for DEC "target := MACRO = string" Makefile syntax.
  Added README notes from Dave Moellenhoff, Lou Henefeld and others.
  Added README.login from James Taylor.
  Added README.client with various notes about building DBD::Oracle
  on minimaly configured client systems.
  Extra parameters to ora_do are now passed to DBI's do().
  (This is an extension to the original oraperl ora_do.)

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.38 (Oraperl 1.28), 22th Aug 1996

  Overhaul of Makefile variable parsing. Should now cope with
  complex variables which expand to nested shell escapes.
  Try perl Makefile.PL -v to watch the fun.
  Updated README, Makefile.PL and test.pl messages for clarity.
  Fixed possible memory corruption in dbd_bind_ph().

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.37 (Oraperl 1.28), 25th July 1996

  Fixed Makefile.PL for Oracle 7.3.2.
  Fixed $num_fields = ora_fetch($csr) before first fetch for
  	queries with bind vars.
  Fixed occasional core dump on global destruct.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.36 (Oraperl 1.28), 10th July 1996

  Fixed bind_param ora_type attribute.
  Fixed preparse to allocate enough memory for worst case.
  Fixed broken HP-UX 10 check in Makefile.PL.
  Other assorted Makefile.PL improvements.
  (Many thanks to those who sent in fixes.)

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.35 (Oraperl 1.28), 21st June 1996

  Fixed broken Solaris 2.5 check in Makefile.PL.
  Added ld path to the log.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.34 (Oraperl 1.28), 21st June 1996

  Workaround Solaris 2 bug #1224467 (_rmutex_unlock).
  With many thanks to James Taylor.

  Added 'Bad free()' warning suppression to ora_logon and
  ora_logoff(). Setting the DBD_DUMP environment variable
  will trigger a (handy for me) core dump if a Bad free
  warning is detected.

  Further additions to the README about Bad free()'s.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.33 (Oraperl 1.27), 19th June 1996

  Added Makefile.PL -g option to enable debugging.
  Added Makefile.PL -s symbol_name option to search for symbols.
  Reorganised the way Makefile.PL uses MakeMaker liblist code.
  Oraperl defaults to the 'safe' (normal) mode of using the DBI.
  Oraperl uses sigtrap on SEGV & BUS to give a perl stack trace.
  Added README notes about -g option, core files and stack traces.
  Small change to $dbname/$user/$passwd logic in connect.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.32 (Oraperl 1.25), 30th May 1996

  Fixed memory leak when FETCH'ing attributes.
  Fixed Makefile.PL FileHandle problem (forgot 'use FileHandle;').
  Enhanced Makefile.PL support for Oracle 7.3.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.31 (Oraperl 1.25), 20th May 1996

  Makefile.PL for HP-UX now defaults to dynamic for hpux >= 10.

  execute (ora_bind/ora_do) now returns undef on error or the
  number of rows affected (0 is returned as 0E0, hence true, for
  okay but no rows affected or no row count available/applicable).
  This matches the oraperl version 2.4 behaviour.

  Made an attempt at supporting Oracle 7.3 (e.g. include's in proc.mk)
  Please let me know if it works (else supply patches to fix it :-)

  Fixed small memory leak in ora_titles etc functions.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.30, 7th May 1996

  THE ORAPERL EMULATION LAYER IS NOW FORMALLY RELEASED (NO LONGER ALPHA).

  Note that the underlying DBI and DBD::Oracle interfaces remain alpha
  because they are still subject to (possibly significant) change.

  Oraperl v2 used to return the string 'OK' to indicate success
  with a zero numeric value. The Oraperl emulation now uses the
  string '0E0' to achieve the same effect since it does not cause
  any -w warnings when used in a numeric context.

  Fixed typecast warning (s/safefree/Safefree).
  Automatically sets/resets ORACLE_HOME from oratab value for sid.

  TO DO: Automatic configuration from Oracle 7.3 is not yet working
  (Oracle have reorganised the makefiles yet again!).

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.29, 2 March 1996

  Fixed Makefile.PL to get DBIXS.h from right spot.
  Changes to suit perl5.002 and site_lib directories.
  Detects old versions ahead of new in @INC.
  Random tidy-ups.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.28, 29 Jan 1996:

  Minor release for Perl5.002 (beta2 or later).
  Requires Perl5.002 and DBI 0.66;

  Only functional change is to suppress (rare) 'handle not setup'
  warnings unless debugging.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.27, 16 Nov 1995:

  Improved oraperl compatibility in assorted ways.
  Added the original oraperl manual to Oraperl.pm as pod.
  (perldoc Oraperl will display the manual).
  The manual highlights remaining differences in the emulation.
  Added original oraperl examples into oraperl.ex directory.

  Improved error reporting in test.pl.
  Removed some internal limits.
  Renamed readblob to blob_read and fixed return value.
  Implemented $sth = $dbh->tables method (see DBI changes file).
  Uses $Config{archlibexp} not $Config{archlib} in makefile.PL
  Requires DBI-0.65.

  I've still not got around to implementing a row cache (array
  fetch) but it's next on my list.

  This should be the last alpha release of the oraperl emulation.
  (The DBD::Oracle module itself will remain alpha for awhile yet.)


* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.26, 23 Oct 1995:

  Removed error message (sql) size limits in parse and ora_error.
  Fixed FETCH NUM_OF_PARAMS so it doesn't trigger a describe.
  The ora_lengths and ora_types attributes work in non-oraperl mode.


* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.25, 26 Aug 1995:

  User visible changes:

  Fixed bug in parsing '?' style placeholders.
  $sth->bind_param now checks for a too long LONG type string.
  $sth->prepare now takes attributes:
  	ora_parse_lang  => 0 | 1 | 2  (v6, auto v6/v7, v7)
  	ora_parse_defer => 0 | 1      (control defered parsing)

  Other changes to be propogated to other drivers:

  Added usage of new DBD_ATTRIB_* macros to XS and C code.
  dbd_bind_ph return value inverted to make it consistent.
  Added braces around XSRETURN_UNDEF in execute.
  Checked for describe failure in FETCH.
  Removed NumParams since it's now called NUM_OF_PARAMS in DBI.
  Updated NEED_DBIXS_VERSION in Oracle.h


* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.24, 22 Aug 1995:

  User visible changes:

  $sth->bind_param method implemented (needs testing :-)
  and new DBI $sth->bind_col* methods work for DBD::Oracle.

  Other changes to be propogated to other drivers:

  - Slight change to STORE functions to allow them to return status
    if called as $h->STORE(...).

  - Revised signature of dbd_bind_ph function and added a bind_param
    method for it. Prototype moved from dbdimp.h to Oracle.h

  - Revised execute method to use modified dbd_bind_ph function and
    remove remaining oracle specifics.

  - imp_xxh_t structures first element now called 'com' not 'dbihcom'
    and new DBI macros used to access fields.


* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.23, 18 Aug 1995:

  Fixed Oraperl.pm debug which was left on by default by accident.
  Added small patches from Davide.Migliavacca@inferentia.it for
  longs (dbtype_is_long, dbd_describe and dbd_st_readblob).
  Added svr4 hints from Alan Burlison <aburlison@cix.compulink.co.uk>
  Changed dbd_describe to return true for success (to be consistent).


* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.22, 17 Aug 1995:

  Much more maturity, in line with the required DBI-0.60 release.
  The .xs file is now very 'clean'. It's an excellent base for
  developing other drivers. See notes in the DBI Changes file.

  The oraperl &ora_do should be working now (along with $sth->do()).
  It does not leak (as far as I can tell).

  This release is stable enough for general use again (like 0.20).
  Please test heavily.


* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.21, 15 Aug 1995:

  NOTE: THIS IS AN UNSTABLE RELEASE!
  It requires the closely related DBI 0.59 release.
  See Changes file in that release.
  Major reworking of internal data management!

  Only execute and fetchrow have yet to move into dbdimp.c.
  These were kept back since I plan other associated changes.

  Known problems:
  Warning mode is on by default so certain oraperl coding
  styles cause warnings such as:
      Statement handle ... destroyed without finish() at ...
      disconnect(...) invalidates 1 associated cursor(s) at ...
  In future oraperl mode handles will have those warnings disabled.
  ...other changes to numerous/minor to mention

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.20, 1 Aug 1995:

  Fixed core dump when binding an undef (treated as a NULL)
  Binding a string longer that 2000 bytes will use LONG type.
  Workaround OSF makefile and oratype.h problems
  PL/SQL := construct will no longer confuse dbd_preparse()

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.19, 21 June 1995:

  Added $VERSION
  disconnect_all now gives error 'not implemented'.
  Reworked memory management, imp_dbh's are cached.
  imp_dbh_t now has an in_use flag and generation counter.
  st::DESTROY now checks its imp_dbh for validity.
  &ora_do() now returns "OK" for 0 rows (as per oraperl).
  Reworked logging to use DBILOGFP macro.
  Now test code added to loop through logon/prep/fin/logoff.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.18, 17th June 1995

  Makefile.PL: HPUX now builds with LINKTYPE=static automatically.
  Fixed errors on logout/global destruction.
  Added logout/global destruction test to test.pl.
  Changed Oraperl.pm default mode from safe to fast (see func_ref()).
  Added platform who's-who list to README.
  Added $sth->readblob($field, $offset, $length [, \$dest) method.
  (You need to add the following after line 80 in DBI/DBI.pm:
     'readblob' =>   {'U'=>[4,5,'$field, $offset, $len [, \\$buf]']},
  in order to access the new readblob method.)

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.17, 9th June 1995

  Further enhancements to proc.mk parsing (this should fix
    the bug introduced in the last version which required the
    manual editing of -lora etc into the link line).
  Automatic use of proc16.mk if proc.mk not found.
  Automatic use of -Xa if compiler is 'clcc' (CenterLine).
  Further migration of code from Oracle.xs to dbdimp.c. This is
    not complete but may give you a flavor of my current direction.
  Fixed more warnings from pedantic compilers.
  [Released with DBI 0.56]

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.16, 25 May 1995

  Makefile.PL more robust and flexible.
  Code restructured - much more still to do.
  Changes to ora_do. It's probably still not right.
  [Released with DBI 0.55]

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.15, 25 Apr 1995

  Fixed all known build problems/core dumps/truncated data etc.
  Returns undef for NULLS.
  Bind vars still not supported (soon I hope).
  Bind vars produce errors rather than being ignored.
  Login usage of ORACLE_SID and TWO_TASK slightly revised.
  test.pl now uses ORACLE_SID, TWO_TASK and ORACLE_USER if defined.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.14, 5 Apr 1995

  Fixed assorted build and core-dump problems.

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.13, 8th March 1995

  "Another alpha release but hey, guess what, this one actually allows
  you to fetch data :-)"

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.12, 1st March 1995

  "For DBD::Oracle I have implemented a fairly radical way to deal with
  the nightmare of Oracle OCI makefiles.  Rather than try to maintain a
  *large* and complicated set of Makefile macros the DBD::Oracle
  Makefile.PL now actually extracts the macros which oracle itself uses
  from $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/lib/oracle.mk!  (The horses mouth, so to speak.)"
  [Released with DBI 0.53]

* Changes in DBD::Oracle 0.11, 24th Feb 1995

  "The first fruits of that work are now available for the brave (or
  foolhardy).  Take note: this very much *unsupported* *alpha* software
  (it does not even fetch records from oracle yet). Feel free to ftp it
  but don't expect to do anything very useful with it."
  Also first release of the Oraperl emulation module:
  "Yes, that's real oraperl code and it works! The only addition is
  the 'use DBD::Oraperl' line."
  [Released with DBI 0.51]
